#Design and Implementation of Blockchain Technology for Real-Time KYC Verification in Nepal’s Banking Sector

Explores how blockchain can enhance Know Your Customer (KYC) verification in Nepalese banks. Traditional KYC processes are slow, inefficient, and prone to security vulnerabilities. Customers must repeatedly submit documents to multiple banks, creating redundancy and increasing the risk of data breaches due to centralized storage. Your research proposes a blockchain-based solution to make KYC verification real-time, decentralized, and tamper-proof.The proposed system allows banks to verify and share customer identity data securely using blockchain. By leveraging immutability, transparency, and cryptographic security, the system reduces fraud risks and improves efficiency. Customers maintain control over their personal information through self-sovereign identity principles, ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance. This approach eliminates the need for repeated document submission while protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.For implementation, your project uses Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum to create a decentralized identity management system. Smart contracts automate KYC verification and ensure real-time updates, while encryption and access control mechanisms prevent data tampering. This integration streamlines the verification process, reduces operational costs, and enhances the security of sensitive financial information.The expected benefits of this system include improved security by removing single points of failure, increased efficiency by reducing processing time, and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and Nepal Rastra Bank’s KYC policies. By leveraging blockchain, Nepalese banks can modernize their KYC verification process, making it more secure, efficient, and fraud-resistant. Your thesis presents a practical and innovative approach to transforming the banking sector with trustless, decentralized, and automated identity verification.
